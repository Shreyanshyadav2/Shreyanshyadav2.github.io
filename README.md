# 💜 Breaking Barriers: Women's Rights and Wellbeing Dashboard

This project provides data-driven insights into **women’s health**, **child mortality**, and **economic development** across the globe. It was developed as part of the UNICEF Visualisation Assignment using Python (Google Colab).

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The dashboard explores key questions:
- Which countries have the highest fertility rates?
- How does **GDP per capita** relate to **child mortality rates**?
- How have child mortality rates changed over time in selected countries?
- Which regions remain most vulnerable globally?

The project uses data visualisations to communicate these insights clearly through:
- 📊 **Bar Chart:** Top 10 countries by fertility rate  
- 📈 **Smoothed Line Chart:** GDP per capita vs child mortality rate   
- 📅 **Time-Series Plot:** Mortality trends over time for 5 countries  
- 🌍 **Global Map (Choropleth):** Average mortality rates by country
